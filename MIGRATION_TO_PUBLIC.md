# Migration to Public Repository

This document outlines the steps completed and remaining actions for making this repository public.

## ‚úÖ Completed Preparations

### Security Cleanup
- [x] Replaced hardcoded AWS account IDs with placeholders
  - Changed `339712917467` to `123456789012` in documentation
  - Added comments indicating where users should replace with their own values
- [x] Verified no sensitive credentials are present
  - All secrets are properly parameterized as Terraform variables
  - No API keys, passwords, or tokens hardcoded
- [x] Added Apache 2.0 LICENSE file
  - Consistent with existing copyright headers in modules

### Repository Review
- [x] CIDR blocks are generic RFC 1918 ranges (10.x.x.x/16)
- [x] Organization name "AdaptiveWorX" is already public on GitHub
- [x] Module structure follows best practices

## üîÑ Actions Required Before Going Public

### 1. Update GitHub Repository Settings
```bash
# In GitHub UI or via CLI:
# Settings ‚Üí Change visibility ‚Üí Public
```

### 2. Update Terragrunt References
Once public, update all Terragrunt configurations in `iac-aws` repository:

**Current (Private):**
```hcl
terraform {
  source = "git::git@github.com:AdaptiveWorX/iac-modules.git//modules/vpc/foundation?ref=v1.0.0"
}
```

**New (Public):**
```hcl
terraform {
  source = "git::https://github.com/AdaptiveWorX/iac-modules.git//modules/vpc/foundation?ref=v1.0.0"
}
```

### 3. Remove/Update Cross-Repository Workflow (Optional)
The `.github/workflows/trigger-downstream-deploy.yml` workflow references the private `iac-aws` repository. Consider:
- **Option A**: Remove the workflow if not needed for public use
- **Option B**: Keep it but ensure `CROSS_REPO_TOKEN` secret is not exposed
- **Option C**: Convert to a dispatch-only workflow that users can fork and customize

### 4. Update Documentation
Consider updating the main README.md to:
- Add a "Getting Started" section for public users
- Include contribution guidelines (CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Add security policy (SECURITY.md)
- Include examples that are more generic/universal

## üìù Post-Migration Checklist

After making the repository public:

1. **Update all Terragrunt configurations** in `iac-aws`:
   ```bash
   # Find all references
   grep -r "git@github.com:AdaptiveWorX/iac-modules" .
   
   # Update to use HTTPS
   find . -name "*.hcl" -exec sed -i '' 's|git@github.com:AdaptiveWorX/iac-modules|https://github.com/AdaptiveWorX/iac-modules|g' {} \;
   ```

2. **Remove PAT_TOKEN requirements** from workflows that reference the modules

3. **Test module access** without authentication:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AdaptiveWorX/iac-modules.git
   ```

4. **Update CI/CD pipelines** to use public URLs

## üéØ Benefits of Going Public

1. **No Authentication Required**: 
   - Terragrunt can access modules without PAT tokens
   - Simplified CI/CD pipeline configuration
   - No need to manage GitHub Deploy Keys

2. **Community Collaboration**:
   - Accept contributions from the community
   - Share best practices with others
   - Get feedback and improvements

3. **Transparency**:
   - Show commitment to open source
   - Build trust through code visibility
   - Enable security audits

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining Sensitive Information

None found. The repository is safe to make public.
