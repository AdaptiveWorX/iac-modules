# Security Cleanup Log - Private Key Removal

## Date: January 9, 2025

### Issue Identified
GitHub detected exposed private key in repository history:
- **File:** `modules/certificates/certs/multi-domain.key`
- **Commit:** `1d19d73633bec2f342d627851bdb74793e1abbcc`
- **Date:** July 2, 2025
- **Also exposed:** Certificate files (.crt, .ca-bundle)

### Cleanup Actions Performed

1. **Created backup branch** before cleanup
   - Branch: `backup-before-cleanup`

2. **Removed sensitive files from Git history**
   - Used `git filter-branch` to remove all traces of:
     - `modules/certificates/certs/multi-domain.key`
     - `modules/certificates/certs/multi-domain.crt`
     - `modules/certificates/certs/multi-domain.ca-bundle`

3. **Cleaned repository**
   - Removed backup refs: `.git/refs/original/`
   - Expired reflog: `git reflog expire --expire=now --all`
   - Garbage collected: `git gc --prune=now --aggressive`

4. **Force pushed to GitHub**
   - Updated main branch and all tags
   - History has been rewritten

### Verification
- Confirmed 0 occurrences of sensitive files in cleaned history
- All commits and tags have been rewritten with new hashes

### Security Measures in Place
- `.gitignore` properly configured to exclude:
  - All certificate file extensions (*.key, *.crt, *.pem, etc.)
  - Certificate directories (**/certs/*)
- Certificate management now uses AWS SSM Parameter Store modules

### CRITICAL NEXT STEPS

⚠️ **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:**

1. **REVOKE THE COMPROMISED CERTIFICATE**
   - Contact your Certificate Authority immediately
   - The private key was exposed and must be considered compromised

2. **GENERATE NEW CERTIFICATE**
   - Create new private key
   - Generate new certificate signing request
   - Obtain new certificate from CA

3. **NOTIFY ALL TEAM MEMBERS**
   - Everyone must re-clone the repository
   - Command: `git clone https://github.com/AdaptiveWorX/iac-modules.git`
   - DO NOT pull/fetch into existing clones

4. **UPDATE ALL SYSTEMS**
   - Replace the certificate in all production systems
   - Update AWS SSM Parameter Store with new certificate
   - Verify all services using the new certificate

5. **MARK GITHUB ALERT AS RESOLVED**
   - Go to GitHub Security tab
   - Find the secret scanning alert
   - Mark as resolved with explanation

### Repository State
- Main branch has been force-pushed with cleaned history
- All tags have been updated with new commit hashes
- Original commits with sensitive data are no longer accessible

### Lessons Learned
- Never commit certificates or private keys to Git
- Always use secure secret management systems (AWS SSM, Secrets Manager)
- Review `.gitignore` before adding sensitive directories
- Use pre-commit hooks to prevent accidental commits of secrets
