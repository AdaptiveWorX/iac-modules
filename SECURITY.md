# Security Policy

## üîí Security Standards

This repository follows infrastructure security best practices to ensure safe and reliable module deployment.

### Our Commitment

- **No hardcoded secrets**: All sensitive values must be variables
- **Least privilege**: IAM policies follow principle of least privilege
- **Encryption by default**: Resources support encryption where available
- **Regular updates**: Dependencies and providers kept current
- **Security scanning**: All PRs undergo automated security checks

## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### DO NOT create public issues for security vulnerabilities

Instead, please report security issues privately through one of these channels:

1. **Email**: security@adaptiveworx.com
2. **GitHub Security Advisories**: [Report a vulnerability](https://github.com/AdaptiveWorX/iac-modules/security/advisories/new)

### What to Include

When reporting a security issue, please provide:

- **Module affected**: Which module has the vulnerability
- **Description**: Clear explanation of the issue
- **Impact**: Potential security impact
- **Steps to reproduce**: How to trigger the vulnerability
- **Suggested fix**: If you have a recommendation

### Response Timeline

- **Initial response**: Within 24 hours
- **Status update**: Within 72 hours
- **Resolution target**: Based on severity (see below)

## üéØ Severity Levels

### Critical (Resolution: 24-48 hours)
- Hardcoded credentials or secrets
- Remote code execution
- Privilege escalation
- Data exposure of sensitive information

### High (Resolution: 3-5 days)
- Authentication bypass
- Insecure default configurations
- Missing encryption for sensitive data

### Medium (Resolution: 1-2 weeks)
- Excessive permissions
- Missing security headers
- Outdated dependencies with known vulnerabilities

### Low (Resolution: Next release)
- Best practice violations
- Missing documentation for security features
- Non-critical dependency updates

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### For Module Users

1. **Always use latest versions** of modules
2. **Enable encryption** where available
3. **Review IAM permissions** before deployment
4. **Use parameter store** or secrets manager for sensitive values
5. **Enable logging and monitoring**
6. **Regularly update** module versions

### For Contributors

#### Secure Coding Guidelines

**Variables for Sensitive Data:**
```hcl
# GOOD - Using variable
variable "database_password" {
  description = "Database password"
  type        = string
  sensitive   = true  # Mark as sensitive
}

# BAD - Hardcoded value
resource "aws_db_instance" "main" {
  password = "SuperSecret123!"  # NEVER DO THIS
}
```

**Encryption by Default:**
```hcl
# GOOD - Encryption enabled
resource "aws_s3_bucket_server_side_encryption_configuration" "main" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.main.id
  
  rule {
    apply_server_side_encryption_by_default {
      sse_algorithm = "AES256"
    }
  }
}
```

**Least Privilege IAM:**
```hcl
# GOOD - Specific permissions
data "aws_iam_policy_document" "minimal" {
  statement {
    actions = [
      "s3:GetObject",
      "s3:ListBucket"
    ]
    resources = [
      aws_s3_bucket.main.arn,
      "${aws_s3_bucket.main.arn}/*"
    ]
  }
}

# BAD - Overly permissive
data "aws_iam_policy_document" "excessive" {
  statement {
    actions   = ["*"]
    resources = ["*"]
  }
}
```

## üîç Security Scanning

### Automated Checks

All pull requests undergo:

1. **tfsec** - Terraform security scanner
2. **checkov** - Infrastructure as code analysis
3. **tflint** - Terraform linter with security rules
4. **Dependency scanning** - Check for vulnerable dependencies

### Manual Security Review

For critical modules, we perform:

- Code review by security team
- Penetration testing of deployed infrastructure
- Compliance validation (SOC2, HIPAA, PCI-DSS where applicable)

## üìã Security Checklist

### Module Development

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] All sensitive variables marked with `sensitive = true`
- [ ] Encryption enabled for data at rest
- [ ] Encryption enabled for data in transit
- [ ] IAM policies follow least privilege
- [ ] Security groups/NACLs properly restricted
- [ ] Logging enabled for audit trail
- [ ] Backup and recovery configured
- [ ] Resource tagging for compliance

### Pre-Deployment

- [ ] Review all variable values
- [ ] Verify encryption settings
- [ ] Check IAM permissions
- [ ] Review network access controls
- [ ] Validate in test environment first
- [ ] Document security considerations

## üöÄ Secure Deployment Patterns

### Using AWS Secrets Manager

```hcl
data "aws_secretsmanager_secret_version" "db_password" {
  secret_id = "rds/production/password"
}

resource "aws_db_instance" "main" {
  password = data.aws_secretsmanager_secret_version.db_password.secret_string
}
```

### Using SSM Parameter Store

```hcl
data "aws_ssm_parameter" "api_key" {
  name = "/application/api_key"
}

resource "aws_lambda_function" "api" {
  environment {
    variables = {
      API_KEY = data.aws_ssm_parameter.api_key.value
    }
  }
}
```

### Environment-Specific Security

```hcl
locals {
  security_config = {
    development = {
      enable_encryption = false  # Cost optimization for dev
      enable_logging    = false
    }
    production = {
      enable_encryption = true   # Required for production
      enable_logging    = true
    }
  }
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "main" {
  # Apply environment-specific security
  server_side_encryption_configuration {
    rule {
      apply_server_side_encryption_by_default {
        sse_algorithm = local.security_config[var.environment].enable_encryption ? "AES256" : null
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## üîê Compliance

### Supported Standards

Our modules are designed to support compliance with:

- **SOC 2 Type II**
- **ISO 27001**
- **HIPAA** (with appropriate configuration)
- **PCI-DSS** (with appropriate configuration)
